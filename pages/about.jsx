            British-Italian Scarlett Casciello embarked on her journey with
            photography from the age of 17 and went on to study fashion
            photography at Falmouth University at degree level. Following
            graduation she made the move to Beijing, quickly building British
            and Chinese editorial and commercial experience. Her multimarket
            commissions harnessed her love of colour, set design, diverse
            casting and deep cultural storytelling.

            Scarlett's vision is very much led by her fascination with the
            beauty of both the female form and nature, with an ever-running
            desire to capture them within environments that are rich in colour
            and structure, giving her imagery at times a timeless and arresting
            illusionary and painterly feeling. Her inspiration continues to stem
            from the exploration of surrealism, nature, and classical art.
